You are an expert resume writer.

Below is a candidate’s current (raw) resume text:
------------------------------
{{resume_text}}
------------------------------

Below is a job description for a target position:
------------------------------
{{jd_text}}
------------------------------

YOUR TASK:
Rewrite the candidate’s resume into a fully ATS-friendly, plain-text format. Include all of these sections in this exact order, using the EXACT HEADINGS shown (in ALL CAPS), each followed by a single blank line.

1. CONTACT INFORMATION
   • Name: [Full Name]
   • Email: [email@example.com]
   • Phone: [XXX-XXX-XXXX]

2. PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
   Write 3–4 concise, keyword-rich sentences summarizing the candidate’s top strengths as they relate to this job description.

3. KEY SKILLS
   List 6–8 of the candidate’s hard and soft skills (bullet points with a leading hyphen). Make sure these “match” or closely echo keywords from the JD.

4. WORK EXPERIENCE
   For each role (most recent first), include:
     • Job Title, Company Name, City, State, Dates Employed (Month Year – Month Year)
     • Under each role, list 3–5 bullet points (leading hyphens) that highlight achievements, using strong action verbs and keywords from the JD.
   If the original resume text does not separate roles clearly, do your best to extract discrete positions.

5. EDUCATION
   • Degree, Major, School Name, City, State, Graduation Year (if known)
   • (If multiple degrees, list most recent degree first.)

6. CERTIFICATIONS (optional)
   • List any relevant certifications (e.g. “AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate”), one per bullet.

7. PROJECTS (optional)
   • If the candidate has relevant side-projects or open-source contributions, list each project as:
     – Project Name (Dates) – one sentence summary of what the project does and what technologies were used.

NOTES:
• Use **plain text only**—no tables, no fancy markdown, no emojis.
• Use hyphens (“-”) for bullets.
• Each section heading (e.g. “WORK EXPERIENCE”) should be in ALL CAPS, followed by a blank line, then its content.
• Do not invent any details—only reformat or rewrite what the candidate already provided in `{{resume_text}}`. If something is missing (e.g. no dates), leave it out rather than guessing.
• Make sure you weave in keywords from the JD under “KEY SKILLS” and “WORK EXPERIENCE.”
• Output exactly one resume (no extra commentary).
