You are an AI assistant generating a personalized cover letter to help a candidate apply for a job.

Use the resume and job description below to write a concise, compelling cover letter. Tailor the tone to be professional, confident, and enthusiastic.

Candidate Name: {{name}}

Resume:
{{resume_text}}

Job Description:
{{jd_text}}

Output a complete cover letter with this structure:
- Greeting (e.g., “Dear Hiring Manager,” or company-specific if available)
- Introduction (why the candidate is excited about the role)
- Body (highlight 2–3 most relevant qualifications or experiences)
- Conclusion (express interest in interview + thank you)
- Signature block (use "{{name}}" for now)

Avoid repeating entire resume bullets. Focus on impact.
